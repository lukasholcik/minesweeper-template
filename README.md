# SolarWinds MineSweeper programming contest

## Main goal

Your task will be to implement the [MineSweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper) game by *satisfying as many prepared unit tests as possible*. Implement the test cases in order, some of them depend on previous ones!

## MineSweeper rules

The rules of minesweeper are simple:
 
- Uncover a mine, and the game ends with failure.
- Uncover an empty cell, and you keep playing.
- Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding cellsâ€”information you use to 
  deduce which nearby cells are safe to click.
- Uncover all unmined cells to win the game.
